The secret? It's all about conversational style matching. Yes. You heard, right? So get ready to be the star man, the star woman of social communication.&nbsp;</p><p>Welcome back to our channel here. We're all about empowering you with the tools you need to skyrocket your communication and social skills and reach a level of social fluency you never thought possible. And today we have something pretty special to talk about.</p><p>A fascinating study by Hogan Anesia, Muff, and Zinsky, reveals the power of conversational style matching. This concept is a game changer in improving interpersonal communication. Let's dive right in, shall we?</p><p>First off, conversational style matching is when two people unconsciously adjust their communication patterns to mirror each other, which leads to better understanding and rapport.</p><p>Imagine you're at a party, you meet someone who's really animated, uses lots of gestures and speaks pretty fast.</p><p>Instead of maintaining your usual slow and calm pace, you match their speed and energy. Congratulations, you just did Conversational style matching.</p><p>Sounds simple, right? But how do you put this into practice? Here are three strategies to help you master conversational style matching.&nbsp;</p><p>Strategy one: mirroring verbal language. Pay attention to the other person's choice of words, phrases, and the rate at which they speak. If they use technical jargon, reciprocate with similar vocabulary. If they speak slowly, slow your pace to match theirs.</p><p>For example, if you're conversing with a sports enthusiast who's using sports terminology, you could say "that goal was a real game changer." Instead of "that goal was important." This builds connection and shows you're engaged.&nbsp;</p><p>Onto strategy number two. Strategy Number two: mirroring body language. Notice their body language. If they lean in when they speak, do the same if they're expressive with their hands, incorporate more hand gestures in conversation. Let's say somebody talks with their hands a lot. Don't just sit there like a statue. Add some dynamics to your expressions. This makes them feel much more comfortable and at ease and engaged in the conversation.</p><p>Strategy number three: mirroring tone and pitch. Listen to the tone and pitch of their voice. If they speak in a soft low tone, try to match it. If they're excited and loud, match their enthusiasm.</p><p>In a business meeting, if your colleague speaks in a firm, a assertive tone, mirror it to show your alignment with them. On the other hand, if they're speaking in a quiet, reflective tone, lower your voice to match theirs.</p><p>Now it's your turn to practice these strategies. Here's the thing, practice makes progress. We understand it's not always easy to apply what you learn instantly, and that's why we've created a platform just for you.</p><p>Introducing Explearning Academy, a dedicated communication community where you can practice these strategies in live workshops a week.

// const demoPostContentTwo = `<p>I get a lot of questions about social anxiety and confidence and just a general uneasy feeling when interacting with people when we're in social settings. And look, I get it. Social anxiety is a really unpleasant feeling, and it could very well deter you from having social connections, social interaction and building your friendships and building your professional network. So it's definitely something that you want to address sooner rather than later. Now, one thing that is very important and is an integral part of social anxiety is reading the room. So we're going to talk all about.</p><p>Alright, so what does reading the room mean? It's this idea that you are aware of the social situation, the social dynamics at play, the key players in the conversation, what's going on, the gist of the situation. And generally speaking, you're socially aware. So someone who has social adeptness and is a social person reads the room automatically without even thinking about it.</p><p>They walk into a social setting or a room, a physical space, and within a few seconds, maybe even a minute, they start picking up on what's going on. They can read if there's tension, they can understand certain emotions. They can understand if there's heightened emotions. They can understand the emotional resonance of the words .</p><p>By tone of voice nonverbals, in addition to the words. So an experienced person, an experienced, socially savvy individual will read the room without even thinking about it. They just do it. Now, for the people who are not this way, this is a skill that you can work on. This idea, this skill of reading the room can actually be taught.</p><p>It can be replicated and it can be worked on. So if you want to be able to read the room, the very first thing, you want to be perceptive instead of just jumping into the conversation without much context. Or if you're a genuinely funny person and you have a great joke to tell. You want to read the room before you do that. You don't want to just blurt out a joke, you want to read the room.</p><p>You want to know if this is an appropriate moment, if this is an appropriate point in the conversation to say that joke. Maybe the audience doesn't care about that joke. Maybe the mood is not humorous or funny in that situation. So again, it comes back to reading the room. So the very first thing you want to is be perceptive. Pay attention to what's going on. Do not chime in, refrain from talking. You want to be actively attentively listening. You want to be able to really assess the situation. And the only way to do that is to be perceptive and to be actively listening. Don't have an agenda. Don't have a list of items that you want to go through.</p><p>Don't share your jokes. Don't workshop your speech. Whatever it might be. You just want to pay attention. Okay? So that's the very first thing. And the second part of that is the active listening, which we discussed.</p><p>Then you want to put out feelers. So once you've assessed the situation by paying attention, by observing people's behavior, their mood, what they're saying, how they're saying it, whether there's an undertone of sarcasm involved, if there's cynicism, directness, whatever it is, what kind of overtone is there?</p><p>And also with cultures. If you are in a cross-cultural setting, or if you are communicating between cultures. That's also a very important aspect of reading the room. Once you've done that, then you want to start putting out feelers. What does that mean? Let's say you've assessed that people seem to be in a happy mood.</p><p>It's Friday, people are excited, they're sharing their weekend plans. Then, that might be a good opportunity for you to say that, you're having a couple people over for a barbecue to, celebrate something and watch the game that's on that night, whatever game. And so if people seem like they're excited or you know they're happy, they're vibing with it, then that might be a good opportunity for you to put out a feeler for inviting people somewhere because they're already in a happy mood.</p><p>Okay? So that could be one thing, or maybe it's a good opportunity for you to find out about, where they're going and maybe you have this idea of going on a camping trip, but you would love to hear about their experience first. They're going to be more inclined to be excited about helping you if you also show interest in their plans of having that camping trip themselves.</p><p>So obviously there's congruity there,. We want to be able to show someone that we care because we're actively listening and we care about, what's going on in their lives. And the synchrony is important, but with putting out feelers, you first have to understand what's going on.</p><p>And then, you can tell your joke or maybe you feel like there's a heaviness in the room and then maybe you found out why there's a heaviness in the room. Maybe someone just got laid off. You can, express, you're sorry for that.</p><p>You can express your sadness for it or whatever it is. Or maybe they're excited about moving on to something else, whatever it is. So you want to be aware of what's going on and then putting out the appropriate communication, the message. And the way to do that is by putting out feelers. So you first start with a sentence or two about something else, but it's going to lead you into ultimately what your message is.</p><p>So by putting out feelers, you're really starting to get closer to what you want to do, whatever speech act it is. If it's telling a joke, if it's telling a story, if it's apologizing, whatever's going on. But of course, it's tied into reading the room and seeing what the general mood is and also what the context is.</p><p>What were they talking about when you walked in? Are you privy to that conversation? Is this something where you walk in and then everyone goes silent? They don't want you there. So reading the room, and if that's the case, let's say you walk in and the room goes silent, then you are not going to sit and chat and stay a while.</p><p>You're going to read that, read the room, read that situation, and be on your way because you're not welcome there at that time because maybe they're talking about something sensitive or they're talking about something that is not related to you whatever the case. We're not going to try to come up with the millions of examples that it could be, but just know that if people were to do that, then why sit and wallow in that.</p><p>Or just pretend like it didn't happen. Later you can find out. This, that or the other. But the point is, reading the room is going to allow you to be more socially savvy, more adept at communicating with people, understanding social context, reading the situation, and I love this term, reading the room because that is what it boils down to.</p><p>And so once you've put out feelers, then you test out things. You see what the response is, what is the feedback? How are people receiving this message. What is their receptivity levels? How receptive are they to your message, to that speech act that you shared to your delivery, to your tonality, to your expressions, whatever it might be.</p><p>You're going to start getting feedback once you test out things and put things out there, and then over time you can polish your delivery. You can change your word choice. You can use alternate expressions. You can finesse and fine tune, and then over time you'll just become even better and better at something.</p><p>For example, if it's an elevator pitch that you're working on, or if you're working on, trying to invite people in a cool and calm way, or you're congratulating somebody. All these different types of speech acts that are very prominent in our day to day lives are important to be able to know how to tackle.</p><p>And so reading the room is what's going to allow you to dismiss that social anxiety, to rather to conquer it. To overcome that uneasiness in social situations because you're so aware of what's going on, you've taken time to, instead of blurt out something, you take time to listen. To understand what's going on, to maybe ask questions when it's appropriate to test out things because you've been perceptive and you've been listening, and you're really thinking about saying things in a way that's going to be respectful and receptive.</p><p>And that's really the formula. So reading the room is what's going to help you become more socially adept and less socially awkward, and also conquering that social anxiety that is so crippling for so many people. All right, so I hope that you enjoyed this lesson.</p><p>Definitely try out these strategies. Start reading the room in any type of context. Try professional contexts, try casual contexts. Try as many contexts as you can because over time that's going to be what gets you to level up and takes you from being an okay communicator to a stellar communicator.</p><p>All right, that's it for me today. Thank you for joining me. I will see you in the next one. Bye for now.</p>`;

// const demoPostContentThree = `<p>Social isolation isn’t always a choice. But how you cope with it is.</p><blockquote><p>“We don’t realize just how social beings we are until that contact is reduced or diminished because we can't leave our homes.”&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>There will always be times in our lives when, for reasons outside our control, we are forced to distance ourselves from others. Often, this is due to illness, or the risk of illness, but the truth is that the world has a way of surprising us, and we never quite know how or why we find ourselves in the situations that we do.</p><p>Fortunately, we are hardly the first people to confront such a challenge, and with the benefit of modern technology and comforts, we are surprisingly well equipped to combat the loneliness and cabin fever that inevitably accompanies it.</p><p>Today I’m sharing strategies for surviving social isolation. You may never know when you’ll need them, and you’ll be glad you have them in your back pocket when you do.</p><p>Social isolation is rough. It doesn’t matter if you’re an introvert, extrovert, or ambivert.&nbsp;</p><p>The reason it is challenging is because social interaction is built into our DNA. Originally, it was a survival mechanism. As cavemen, we had greater strength in numbers, so the more social people were more likely to survive than those who kept to themselves.</p><p>Today, we still have that same ancient programming, and we continue to depend on social interaction for our happiness and well-being. In fact, it is so important that we decided to dedicate an entire YouTube channel to the topic!</p><p>As Laura Hawryluck, a critical care physician and associate professor at the University of Toronto, so articulately put it: “We don’t realize just how social beings we are until that contact is reduced or diminished because we can't leave our homes.”</p><p>So of course, our instinct when we are socially isolated is to seek sources of social contact. In today’s world, I think we all know where we are most likely to turn first.</p><p>Social media. I mean, common, it’s got “social” right there in its name. It’s built for this!</p><p>Well slow down there, cowboys and cowgirls!&nbsp;</p><p>What I’m about to share might rock your boat a bit, but I’m cool with that.</p><p>During periods of social isolation, the LAST place you should turn to is social media.</p><p>Think about it. If you are socially isolated due to a crisis, as soon as you plug into social media, you are guaranteed to be inundated with terrifying information on how the crisis is worsening. Not exactly a soothing experience.</p><p>But there’s a more fundamental reason why social media doesn’t work. Social media is designed to broadcast, not connect. It’s designed to give content as wide an audience as possible. And so, ask yourself, what feels more socially fulfilling to you: speaking to your best friend directly, or speaking to an entire auditorium of semi-acquaintances and all-out strangers?</p><p>Broadcasting to the masses, and consuming what the masses are putting out there, particularly knowing that their objective is to garner as much attention as possible, meaning much of it is grossly exaggerated or flat out fake, is a recipe for an even deeper sense of isolation.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s bad news, pun intended.</p><p>Give social media a rest and let’s instead take a look at a few far more rewarding ways to combat social isolation:</p><h2>Write a letter</h2><p>Yes, an actual letter. Post it in the mail and wait to get one back!</p><p>Do you have a friend who you used to write letters to? Do you have a friend who might like to receive a letter from you?&nbsp;</p><p>Perfect. Take out a piece of paper or make a nice card DIY and get to it! Since so much of our day is spent typing it’s a nice refreshing change to take a pen in your hand and write.&nbsp;</p><p>What do you write about? Maybe talk about social isolation and how you’re combatting it, the world, and other musings. The point is to spend some time carefully penning something nice that your friend will receive. You can even ask them ahead of time to be pen pals. Why not? At least for the duration of the social isolation.&nbsp;</p><p>The important thing about this is that the very act of writing itself is soothing. When you write, your mind keeps you company, and the image in your head of the person to whom you are writing also keeps you company, and all of this gets your mind focused on engaging with someone that matters to you rather than worrying about what’s going on outside of your control.</p><p>There’s no wonder that writing is often suggested as a treatment for depression and anxiety.</p><p>Get a pen and paper and see for yourself.</p><h2>Write a Long Email</h2><p>If a pen and paper aren’t readily available, email is a great alternative.</p><p>Email allows for much of the cathartic benefits of writing while also offering a bit more immediacy and the opportunity to really dig into a topic.</p><p>You aren’t constrained by the size of the envelope or the cramping muscles in your hands, so if you have something to say, oh boy can you say it.</p><p>Normally, we recommend keeping emails as short as you possibly can while still conveying what you need to convey. But when your goal is to stave off the loneliness of social isolation, you can ignore that advice.</p><p>The objective here is to open a topic of conversation, or even multiple topics, without any endgame in mind. You share, they share back, and that is enough.&nbsp;</p><p>Choose subjects you are both passionate about, anything that really gets you on your soap box. That will ensure lots of heated back and forth, which is perfect for the occasion! Discuss, philosophize, disagree, make bold claims.&nbsp;</p><p>If no topic comes to mind, find a compelling article or book and discuss that. Kind of like a book club! You can even send them some questions or thoughts you have and go from there.&nbsp;</p><h2>Make Lengthy, Unessential Phone Calls</h2><p>By unessential, I mean that you are not calling for any specific purpose other than to say hello and exchange your feelings and experiences.</p><p>Too often these days our conversations are relegated to choppy snippets in texting apps. Rarely do we turn to the phone when we have convenient asynchronous communication channels.</p><p>But what makes the phone inconvenient is also what makes it beautiful. Yes, it requires both people to be available. More important, it requires both people to be present, at least more than a text message does.</p><p>It allows both interlocuters to engage in spontaneous, stream-of-consciousness dialogue, the way our ancient human software is accustomed to, and that process releases a cocktail of wonderful chemicals that make us feel good and cared for.</p><p>So call up your grandma. Or parents. Or siblings. Or a relative. Or a friend who lives in another state or country. And have a long, unhurried conversation. Get into the details. All the details. Relish the time that you have to elaborate on the intricacies of life.&nbsp;</p><h2>Upgrade to Video Chats</h2><p>Video chats bring all the advantages of phone calls with the added sensory benefit of seeing the person.&nbsp;</p><p>This opens up a whole new level of social interaction and can meaningfully enrich the experience. Suddenly, not only are you enjoying a conversation, but you also feel more of their presence.</p><p>You can even do fun things like have a meal together. Just set the cameras up on your table, lay out your food, perhaps a cup of tea, and engage with one another as if you were sitting across the table at a restaurant.</p><p>This of course isn’t limited to meals. Grab a puzzle, read a book aloud, cook something together, or even fire up the karaoke. Treat it like you were in the room together and pass the time however you please!</p><p>The point is, once you treat their video presence like their physical presence, you begin to benefit in a similar way to them actually being there.</p><p>Sure, it’s not really the same thing, but it’s a heck of a lot better than nothing!</p><p>-----</p><p>So there we have it, four great ways to ward of the loneliness of social isolation that will keep you far away from social media.</p><p>Let’s quickly recap:</p><ol><li>Write a real, paper letter, with your hands and ink and all of that. Just the act of writing has therapeutic benefits.</li><li>Send an epic email. Find the juiciest most enlightening topic you can think of and really dig into it.</li><li>Make totally unnecessary calls, the kind where absolutely nothing is accomplished other than you making each other feel better.</li><li>Upgrade to video chat and make a full-blown virtual get-together out of it: music, tea, coffee, cake, candles and all!</li></ol><p>A fun way to look at this is to treat each of these strategies as a little quest. Try completing one a day and see how it goes.</p><p>Keep at it and you’ll start to feel much better and less socially isolated. We’re lucky that we live in a time when we have many ways to stay in touch with the people we care about.&nbsp;</p><p>Social isolation is tough, but it is temporary, and it’s in our power to make it a heck of a lot more enjoyable than it sounds.</p><p>So now that I've shared our thoughts, I would love to hear about how you are surviving social isolation.

// const demoPostContentFour = `<p>When it comes to public speaking, nonverbal communication is very important. Today I’m sharing some do’s and don'ts for body language for public speaking. These strategies will help you in your next presentation, meeting, or public speaking engagement!</p><p>Let’s get to it.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;</p><h4>Let’s start with head movement.</h4><h3>1) Do Make Eye Contact</h3><p>It’s important to make eye contact with the audience. Try to single in on specific people in the audience rather than just floating&nbsp; your gaze above people’s heads. They will know the difference. Eye contact feels more personal and it establishes rapport and a personal connection.</p><h3>2) Don’t Look Down</h3><p>Every so often you might look down and that might not be a huge deal provided that you’re not constantly averting your gaze from the audience or listeners. If you have notes or note cards in your hand then try to be familiar enough with the content that you won’t be glued to your notes.</p><h3>3) Be Mindful of Your Gaze</h3><p>Be mindful of where you look. If you’re looking up at the ceiling, it could signal boredom and lack of interest. If you’re staring at the clock or your watch it shows that you want this meeting or presentation to be over asap. If your gaze is at the door, you signal a desire to escape. These might be obvious to you right now, but sometimes we automatically place our gaze in places that reveal our intentions, without even knowing it.&nbsp;</p><h3>4) Don’t Touch Your Face</h3><p>Avoid the urge to touch your face. You might have stray hairs in your face or have something in your eye. Try not to fidget. Take care of the stray hairs ahead of your talk or meeting so that you can minimize the urge to take care of it during your talk. It goes without saying that you should touch or blow your nose and don’t touch your ears, eyes, or mouth either. Doing so is the opposite of professional, and can easily be avoided if you’re aware of it. The same applies to fidgeting with clothing. Wear something comfortable that you won’t be fixing during your talk. That would be distracting and prevent the listeners and audience from processing and absorbing what you’re sharing.</p><h3>5) Do Smile</h3><p>Smile the way you would smile. Some people have big beaming smiles, others have more reserved smiles. You do you. Smiling is great because it immediately sets you at ease and it also conveys a sense of calm confidence to the audience, which will boost their impression of you.</p><h4>What about hand gestures for public speaking?</h4><h3>1) Do Use Outwardly Sweeping Gestures</h3><p>This is important because it shows that you’re confident and not afraid to take up space with your body. It’s a way of asserting yourself and demonstrating authority. Keep your hands visible while you do this. If you’re talking about a fishing trip, demonstrate the size of the fish you caught with your hands. It’s as simple as that.&nbsp;</p><h3>2) Don’t Hide Your Hands</h3><p>Keep your hands visible. Don’t stuff your hands in your pockets. Don’t clasp your hands and hide them behind your back. Don’t cross your arms and stuff your hands into your armpits. You need to keep your hands visible because that shows trust and confidence. If you’re leading a meeting, keep your hands on the table in front of you.</p><h3>3) Do Let Your Hands Convey Emotion</h3><p>Use your hands to express emotion. If you’re telling a heartwarming story, place your hand on your heart. If you’re expressing gratitude, put your hands together in thanks. Also leverage your facial expressions for this.</p><h3>4) Do Show Confidence</h3><p>Keep your hands out in front of you, where you can see them and where the audience can see them. Use the steeple when making a point. Open one palm and then the next to make point A and B. Use the visible outline starting from the top with points one two and three, as if to show an outline. Use gestures to make a point rather than overdoing it or under utilizing your hands. In other words, be deliberate about using your hands. Punctuate the important points rather than every single thing you have to say.</p><h3>5) Don’t Play with Your Hands</h3><p>Don’t wring your hands. Don’t play with your hands. This is distracting and it shows insecurity and lack of confidence. The audience wants to listen to someone who appears confident and credible.&nbsp;</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;</p><p>So those are 10 do’s and don'ts for nonverbal communication while public speaking. They can be applied to talks, meetings, or presentations. Leverage these strategies every time you are interfacing with your audience because they will help you get your message across more smoothly and effectively. Be sure to practice these techniques and familiarize yourself with them so that when you’re ready to use them they’ll be automatic to you.</p><p>Feel free to record yourself practicing these nonverbal techniques so that you can see how you are implementing them. Review the video footage with a kind yet critical eye so that you can level up at your next public speaking venture!</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;</p><p>Alright Explearners that’s it from me today.
